            Connecting with the Community<br>
            To choose a suitable community for our event, we analyzed multiple options, ultimately<br> selecting Secondary School No. 39 in Sumqayit.<br> Access to such events is limited there.<br> The school principal, Bakhsheish Alamshakhov, warmly welcomed us and helped<br> organize the event, scheduled for November 6th, from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM.</p>

                We worked to inspire student participation,<br> briefing them on the event's educational value
                and the certificates they<br> could earn.<br> With the principal’s help, we informed various classes,<br>
                eventually selecting 20 students from the 5th and 7th grades.<br> Parental approval was secured
                for participation<br> and media coverage to avoid any issues.<br><br><br><br>
                
                Hosting the "Hour of Code"<br>
                The school provided essential equipment, <br>including computers, a projector,
                and internet access. Due to space<br> limitations, we split participants into two groups. 
                <br>The session began with a presentation about ADA University by team<br> member Nurjahan,
                tailored to the students’ level. 
                While the<br> projector had limited clarity, individual computers
                ensured students<br> understood the material.<br> The team assisted students throughout, 
                resolving <br>difficulties and maintaining engagement. <br>Despite logistical challenges, 
                students' enthusiasm made the effort worthwhile.<br><br><br><br>
                
                Post-Event: Certificate Distribution<br>
                At the event's conclusion, participants shared reflections and received certificates.<br>
                We captured <br> memorable moments with group photos, <br>encouraged students to excel in their studies,
                and addressed their<br> additional questions.<br> 
                Before leaving,<br> we thanked the principal and staff for their support.</p>
